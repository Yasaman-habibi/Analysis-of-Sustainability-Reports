We determined that the Operating Company is a variable interest entity VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary of the Operating Company. Accordingly, pursuant to the VIE accounting model, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2019, we consolidated the Operating Company in our consolidated financial statements and reported a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by the members of the Operating Company (other than the Common Units held by us) on our consolidated financial statements.', 'On August 31, 2021, we completed our previously announced merger with KushCo Holdings, Inc. (\"KushCo\") and have included the results of operations of KushCo in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss from that date forward. In connection with the merger with KushCo, the Greenlane Certificate of Incorporation was amended and restated (the A R Charter in order to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of Greenlane Class B common stock, par value per share (the Class B common stock ), from million shares to million shares in order to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of Class C common stock, par value per share (the Class C common stock ), into one-third of one share of Class B common stock, (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from million shares to million shares, and (iii) eliminate references to the Class C common stock.

The Up-C structure allows the Operating Company to continue to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or pass-through entity. One of these benefits is that future taxable income of the Operating Company that is allocated to its members will be taxed on a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the Operating Company entity level. Additionally, because a member may redeem their Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a -for-one basis or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C structure also provides the member with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically afforded. \\n 10', \"of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some cases, are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) the step-up in tax basis in our share of the Operating Company's assets resulting from the redemption of Common Units under the mechanism described above and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register the resale of shares of Class A common stock that are issuable to the Operating Company s members upon redemption or exchange of their Common Units. \\n The A R Charter and the Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company (the Operating Agreement require that (a) we at all times maintain a ratio of Common Unit owned by us for each share of our Class A common stock issued by us (subject to certain exceptions), and (b) the Operating Company at all times maintains (i) a -to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us, and (ii) a -to-one ratio between the number of shares of our Class B common stock owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company and the number of Common Units owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company.\", 'As of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock, and we owned of the voting and economic interests in Greenlane through the holders\\' ownership of Class A common stock.

In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an \"at-the-market\" equity offering program (the \"ATM Program\") that provides for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50 million, from time to time.

In light of our low cash position, we have been forced to sell stock under our ATM program at prices that may not otherwise be attractive and are dilutive. We have sold 2.2 million in securities pursuant to Instruction I.B.6 in the 12 calendar months preceding the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Conversely, management expects limited efforts related to re-designing user access roles and permissions in the legacy ERP system in 2023. Based on these considerations, and subject to management s ongoing assessment, we do not expect that the previously reported material weaknesses related to ineffective user access controls will be considered remediated until we complete the implementation of our new ERP system.

Under the guidance provided by ASC 360-10-35, the carrying amounts of any assets that are not within the scope of ASC 360-10, other than goodwill, should be adjusted for impairment, as necessary, prior to testing long-lived assets for impairment under ASC-350-10 and the carrying amount of assets within the scope of ASC 360-10 should be adjusted for impairment prior to testing goodwill for impairment under ASC 350-10. \\n Additionally, on January 2, 2024, the Audit Committee, after consultation with management and discussions with Marcum LLP, concluded that the that the Company's ERP system capitalized cost was impaired due to the system not being able to be sold separately from the business, and the current enterprise value of the business does not support the carrying value of the ERP system.\", 'On February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods and Kim International LLC, entered into an agreement with a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately million in cash, an economic participation interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program.', \"The Company has incurred net losses of million and million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.

Industrial segment decreased 43.3 and Consumer segment decreased 9.9 million or 62.1 . The Consumer segment decrease was attributable principally to our shift in strategy to focus on in-house brands that carry a higher margin profile while decreasing third-party brand offerings, which generated top line revenue with lower margins and in some cases higher working capital needs. Consumer segment sales were also affected by the sale of the Company's minority interest in the Vibes brand during 2022. The Industrial segment decrease was largely associated with the introduction of two strategic partnerships which resulted in a decrease in top line revenue for packaging and vape products but allow us to reduce our overall working capital needs and cost-structure and enhance our margins.

The Industrial segment decrease was largely associated with the introduction of two strategic partnerships which resulted in a decrease in top line revenue for packaging and vape products but allow us to reduce our overall working capital needs and cost-structure and enhance our margins. The Company continues to invest in technology and product development to increase the adoption of its consumer brands. \\n Cost of Sales and Gross Margin\", 'Other expense, net. \\n Other expense, net, decreased by approximately 0.5 million or 84.7 to 0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 0.6 million other expense, net, for the same period in 2022. The change is primarily due a loss related to the change in fair value of equity investment of 0.6 million recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2022.', 'Other expense, net, decreased by approximately 0.7 million or 121.9 to 0.1 million other income, net, for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 0.6 million other expense, net, for the same period in 2022.

We raised approximately 3.8 million in connection with the July 2023 Offering and approximately 3.0 million in connection with the Future Receivables Financings in July and August 2023. As a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months.
